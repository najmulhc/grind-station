## âœ… Linked List Operations Checklist

### ðŸŸ© Level 0: Foundation (Redo & Reinforce)
- [x] Create a Node class with constructors (fix this-> bug)
- [x] Convert an array into a singly linked list
- [x] Print all elements of a linked list
- [x] Count the size of the linked list

---

### ðŸŸ¨ Level 1: Basic Insertions & Deletions
- [x] Insert a node at the end
- [x] Insert a node at the beginning
- [ ] Insert a node at a given index (position)
- [x] Delete the first node
- [ ] Delete the last node
- [ ] Delete a node at a specific index

---

### ðŸŸ§ Level 2: Searching & Utility
- [x] Search for a value (true/false)
- [x] Return the index of a value (or -1 if not found)
- [ ] Find the middle node of the list

---

### ðŸŸ¥ Level 3: Reverse Logic
- [ ] Reverse the linked list (iterative)
- [ ] Reverse the linked list (recursive â€“ optional if time)

---

### ðŸ”¥ Level 4: Spicy Challenges (Try Only If Time)
- [ ] Check if the linked list is a palindrome
- [ ] Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list
- [ ] Merge two sorted linked lists

---

### ðŸ§¨ Bonus: Cycle Ops (Optional for now)
- [ ] Detect a cycle using Floyd's Algorithm
- [ ] Remove the cycle
- [ ] Find the starting node of the cycle
